Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goal of this app is to allow a user to log in, ask for SMS permissions, and to provide CRUD functionality on Event objects.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  I decided to push the requirement for a table display of the events for a recycling card view of the events. I also added the expanding cards for additional     
  details. I believe these were both greatly beneficial to the UI. There is no way to tell if they were actually successful at this point but I believe that it would 
  be much easier or users to navigate and would be a selling point for the app.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I used to concepts of abstraction and maintainibility to ensure the separation of concerns to the best of my ability. I could improve the apps maintainibility by 
  refctoring strings and resources as well as verifying the loose coupling is correctly inplemented.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I manually tested it with targeted inputs and I found several issues that I was able to fix. I did not spend as much time as I wanted to as the deadline was close 
  and I was on vacation but I feel it is fairly solid.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I think I made a plan fairly easy but I had to change the plan and strip out features that were not necessary to the rubric to conserve time annd complexity.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I am proud of my learning on recyclerViews and cardViews and implementing them with an adapter. This was new to me and I pushed myself to get it done as that was 
  my vision for the app. I think it is this kind of learning that sticks the most.
